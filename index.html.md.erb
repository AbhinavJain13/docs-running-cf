### Deploying Cloud Foundry

[BOSH](/bosh/) is the recommended and supported means to [deploy Cloud Foundry](/deploying/index.html).
However, BOSH is more than a provisioning and deployment tool.
It is also the tool you use to manage and troubleshoot existing Cloud Foundry instances.

### Managing Cloud Foundry

- [Logging](managing-cf/logging.html)
