## <a id='deploying'></a> Deploying Cloud Foundry ##

[BOSH](/bosh/) is the recommended and supported means to [deploy Cloud Foundry](/deploying/index.html).
However, BOSH is more than a provisioning and deployment tool.
It is also the tool you use to manage and troubleshoot existing Cloud Foundry instances.
