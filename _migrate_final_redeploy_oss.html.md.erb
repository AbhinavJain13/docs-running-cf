After migrating your apps to Diego, perform a final redeploy. This redeploy can end your installation's support for DEA architecture, or configure it to support Diego and DEA concurrently. The following steps describe how to perform this final redeploy for each of these scenarios.

###Diego-only Deployment
To support Diego only, perform the following steps: 

1. Scale down the DEA and Health Manager VMs to 0 instances. Locate the following component configuration under `jobs` in your Cloud Foundry manifest and edit the `instances` property:
        <pre>
        jobs:
          - name: hm9000\_ZONE-NUMBER
            instances: 0
          [...]
          - name: runner\_ZONE-NUMBER
            instances: 0
        </pre>
1. In your Cloud Foundry manifest, locate the following component configuration under `properties.cc.jobs` and edit the `user_can_select_backend` property.
        <pre>
        properties:
          cc:
            jobs:
              users\_can\_select\_backend: false
        </pre>
1. Redeploy.

###DEA and Diego Deployment

To continue support for both Diego and DEA, perform the following steps:

1. Scale the DEA component VMs down to a capacity needed for future apps on DEAs. Locate the following component configuration under `jobs` in your Cloud Foundry manifest and edit the `instances` property:
        <pre>
        jobs:
          - name: hm9000\_ZONE-NUMBER
            instances: INSTANCE-NUMBER
          [...]
          - name: runner\_ZONE-NUMBER
            instances: INSTANCE-NUMBER
        </pre>
1. In your Cloud Foundry manifest, locate the following component configuration under `properties.cc.jobs` and edit the `user_can_select_backend` property. 
        <pre>
        properties:
          cc:
            jobs:
              users\_can\_select\_backend: true
        </pre>
1. Redeploy.

After your final redeploy, you can optionally [verify your migration](#verify) again.
