This topic describes how to migrate the applications in your deployment from the DEA architecture to the Diego architecture. See the [Differences Between DEA and Diego Architectures](../concepts/diego/dea-vs-diego.html) topic for more information.

## <a id='post-upgrade'></a>Migrating Apps After Upgrading to Diego ##

To avoid downtime, you should migrate your apps to Diego before upgrading <%= vars.product_name %>. If you have already upgraded, you can get your apps running again by redeploying them with `cf restage`. To do this, run the following for each app:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf restage APP
</pre>

After this restaging, your apps should run again.

## <a id='prep-tools'></a>Prepare for Migration ##

Before migrating your apps you may need to perform the following tasks:

- [Scale up your Diego VMs to handle the increased load.](#scale-diego) 
- [Enable Diego as the default runtime for your apps.](#enable-diego)
- [Ensure you have the standard cf CLI.](#install-cli)
- [Disable any port-based health checks on worker applications.](#disable-health-checks)
- [Replace environment variables in your app code.](#app-code)
- [List the apps you need to migrate.](#list-apps)  

### <a id='scale-diego'></a>Scale Your VMs ##

<%= partial 'migrate_scale_oss' %>

### <a id="enable-diego"></a>Enable Diego as Default ###

<%= partial 'migrate_enable_oss' %>

### <a id='install-cli'></a>Install the cf CLI ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you use a Java-based build system like Eclipse, STS, Maven, or Gradle, you may have only the Java cf-client. The Java cf-client does not currently support the migration command nor disabling health checks.</p>

You must install both the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) and the [Diego-Enabler CLI Plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/Diego-Enabler). For more information about installing the cf CLI, see the [Installing the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) topic. For more information about installing the Diego-Enabler CLI Plugin, see the Diego-Enabler [repository readme](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/Diego-Enabler).

### <a id='disable-health-checks'></a>Disable Port-Based Health Checks ##

Worker applications pushed with the `--no-route` option do not report as healthy after migrating to Diego. To prevent this, disable the port-based health check with `cf set-health-check APP_NAME none`.

### <a id='app-code'></a>Remove Unsupported Variables from your App Code ##

* Diego does not use the `VCAP_APP_HOST` environment variable. If your code references this variable, replace it with `0.0.0.0`. 

* Diego does not use the `VCAP_APP_PORT` environment variable. If your code references this variable, replace it with `PORT`, which is set to `8080` by default. 

### <a id='list-apps'></a>List DEA and Diego Applications ##

To find out what apps you have running on DEAs and Diego Cells, use the commands `cf dea-apps` and `cf diego-apps`. See the following example:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf dea-apps

Getting apps on the DEA runtime as example_user...
OK

name        org        space

dea-app1    org1    space1
dea-app2    org1    space2
...
</pre>

Use the `-s` flag followed by a space name to limit the search to apps running within the space, or the `-o` flag followed by an org name to limit the search to apps running within the org. See the following example:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf dea-apps -o MY-ORG

Getting apps on the DEA runtime in org MY-ORG as example_user...
OK

name        org        space

dea-app1    MY-ORG    space1
dea-app2    MY-ORG    space2
</pre>

## <a id='migrate'></a>Migrate Your Apps

<%= vars.product_short %> provides three approaches to migrating your apps to Diego:

* [Overwrite-based migration](#migration-with-downtime) migrates an app with a few steps and a brief downtime.

* [Batch migration](#batch-migration) performs overwrite-based migration for all apps in an org, space, or deployment with the single CLI command `cf migrate-apps`.

* [Blue-green migration](#blue-green-migration) avoids downtime by employing [Blue-Green deployment](../devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html).

### <a id='migration-with-downtime'></a>Overwrite-Based Migration###

This procedure overwrites existing app instances with new ones on the Diego architecture, resulting in a brief (~1 minute) downtime. This approach requires fewer steps than the zero downtime blue-green deployment procedure described below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Use overwrite-based migration if a short downtime is acceptable.</p>

1. Use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to install the Diego-Enabler plugin.
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community <span>http:</span>//plugins.cloudfoundry.org/
$ cf install-plugin Diego-Enabler -r CF-Community
</pre>

1. Run `cf enable-diego APP-NAME` to enable Diego for your app.
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf enable-diego EXAMPLE-APP
Setting EXAMPLE-APP Diego support to true
OK
<br>
Verifying EXAMPLE-APP Diego support is set to true
OK
</pre>

1. Confirm that `APP-NAME` runs properly.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app EXAMPLE-APP
</pre>

###<a id="batch-migration"></a>Batch Migration

This procedure migrates multiple apps in a single command using overwrite-based migration. The `cf migrate-apps` command migrates all apps in a deployment unless you specify an org or space. 

- Run `cf migrate-apps diego` to migrate apps to Diego. You can specify the following options:
    - `-o ORG` migrates all apps in an org.
    - `-s SPACE` migrates all apps in a space that exists in your currently targeted org. If you want to migrate apps in a space from another org, you must target that org before running `cf migrate-apps`.
    - `-p MAX_IN_FLIGHT` specifies how many apps to migrate in parallel, up to 100. Defaults to 1. <%= vars.pcf_rec %> recommends first trying a migration with the default and then increasing `-p` if the first migration is stable. Do not set `-p` to a value greater than the number of Diego cells in the deployment. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Migrating a running app causes a restart. Migrating a stopped app does not cause a restart.</p>

The following example migrates all DEA apps in a deployment to Diego. The apps migrate in the sequence specified by running `cf dea-apps`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf migrate-apps diego

Migrating apps to Diego as example_user....

Started migrating app my-app to Diego as example_user...

Completed migrating app my-app to Diego in space with guid a045rw51-o358-4e26-9dfc-4c7365cf987 as example_user

...

Migration to Diego completed: 23 apps, 0 warnings
</pre>

The following example migrates all DEA apps in `space2` to Diego, ten at a time.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf migrate-apps -s space2 -p 10 diego
</pre>

### <a id='blue-green-migration'></a>Blue-Green Migration ###

The blue-green deployment method migrates your apps with zero downtime. This method temporarily runs your apps in parallel using both the DEA and Diego architectures.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If necessary, complete the <a href="#application-rollback">Application Rollback procedure</a> below to revert the migration with zero downtime.</p>
#### <a id="blue-green-procedure"></a>Migrate an App from DEA to Diego Architecture

1. Use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to install the Diego-Enabler plugin.
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community <span>https:</span>//plugins.cloudfoundry.org/
$ cf install-plugin Diego-Enabler -r CF-Community
</pre>

1. Push your application with a new name and a test route for your application. This app will run on the Diego architecture. Do not use the name or route of the existing application.
<pre class="terminal">$ cf push NEW-APP -d MY-DOMAIN.COM -n TEMP-SUBDOMAIN</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
The currently deployed application, OLD-APP, and the application you are pushing, NEW-APP, must be the same version. Otherwise, any static assets served from your application, like CSS and Javascript, will not be consistent across both apps. Now is not the time to upgrade your app.
</p>

1. Confirm that `NEW-APP` runs properly.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app NEW-APP
</pre>

1. Run `has-diego-enabled` to confirm that the application is running on the Diego architecture.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf has-diego-enabled NEW-APP
</pre>

1. If the `has-diego-enabled` command returns false, then set the `diego` boolean to true:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf enable-diego NEW-APP
</pre>

1. Map the route for your application running on the DEA architecture to `NEW-APP`. This remapping creates a second route that splits your traffic between the DEA and Diego architectures.
<pre class="terminal">$ cf map-route NEW-APP MY-DOMAIN.COM -n MY-SUBDOMAIN</pre>

1. Unmap the route from the application running on the DEA architecture. This action sends all of the traffic to the application that is running on Diego.
<pre class="terminal">$ cf unmap-route OLD-APP MY-DOMAIN.COM -n MY-SUBDOMAIN
</pre>

1. After confirming that the new application is running correctly on Diego, stop `OLD-APP` to route all traffic to `NEW-APP` and complete the blue-green migration.
<pre class="terminal">$ cf stop OLD-APP</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
Verify that your application is still accessible and runs properly. If there is a problem with your app, do not complete this procedure. Instead, proceed to the Application Rollback procedure below.
</p>

1. Delete the old application.
<pre class="terminal">$ cf delete OLD-APP</pre>

1. Optional: Delete the route to the TEMP-SUBDOMAIN that you specified when pushing the Diego app for testing. See [Delete a Route](../devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#delete-route).


#### Application Rollback Procedure <a id='application-rollback'></a>

If necessary, complete this procedure to revert your application to the DEA architecture with zero downtime.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
This procedure only works if you have not deleted your application that runs on the DEA architecture.
</p>

1. Start your app using the pre-migration name.
<pre class="terminal">$ cf start OLD-APP</pre>

1. Map `OLD-APP` to your domain.
<pre class="terminal">$ cf map-route OLD-APP MY-DOMAIN.COM -n MY-SUBDOMAIN</pre>

1. Unmap the app running on the Diego architecture from your domain.
<pre  class="terminal">$ cf unmap-route NEW-APP MY-DOMAIN.COM -n MY-SUBDOMAIN</pre>

##<a id="verify"></a>Verify Migration

To verify a successful migration of your apps from DEA to Diego, perform the following steps:

1. Run `cf dea-apps` to list any apps running on DEAs. Verify that the list returned by the command is empty.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf dea-apps -o MY-ORG

    Getting apps on the DEA runtime in org MY-ORG as example_user...
    OK

    name        org     space

    </pre>

1. Run `cf diego-apps` to list any apps running on Diego. Verify that all of your apps are running on Diego.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf diego-apps -o MY-ORG

    Getting apps on the Diego runtime in org MY-ORG as example_user...
    OK

    name        org     space
    diego-app1  MY-ORG  MY-SPACE
    diego-app2  MY-ORG  MY-SPACE
    </pre>

##<a id='redeploy'></a> Final Redeploy

<%= partial 'migrate_final_redeploy_oss' %>

##<a id="troubleshoot"></a>Troubleshoot Migrated Apps

Because Diego was written to be compatible with DEA architecture, most applications migrated from DEAs to Diego cells continue to run on Diego without change. However, there are differences between DEA and Diego architectures. If you have problems with your application after migrating, review the following:

#### Symptom

Error: `Runner error: desired app failed: 503`

#### Explanation

Diego places a 4KB limit on the maximum size of application routes, space for 40 to 50 medium-sized 50-character routes. This error indicates you have exceeded the limit.  

#### Solution

In some cases, you can work around this by using a wildcard route, for example, `*.my-domain.com` instead of mapping individual routes.  If you see this error and you cannot wildcard the routes, create another instance of the same application and bind the remaining routes to the second application instance.

<hr>  

#### Symptom

Large applications may fail to stage, typically resulting in the following error: `Copying into the container failed`.

#### Explanation

Large applications may fail to stage because of a [known issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-design-notes/blob/master/migrating-to-diego.md#disk-quota-over-enforcement-during-container-setup) where disk usage is over-reported.

#### Solution

By default, apps have a 1GB disk quota. If your application files are close to this size, use the `-k` option of `cf push` to increase your disk quota.

<hr>  

#### Symptom

Running the `cf files` command results in the error: `Request failed for app: APP_NAME, instance: INST_NUM and path: PATH` 

#### Explanation

Diego does not support the `cf files` command.

#### Solution

Run the `cf ssh APP_NAME` command to list files in your application instances.

<hr>  

#### Symptom

Errors related to environment variables

#### Explanation

Diego does not support the interpolation of environment variables. In the DEA architecture, when you set environment variables with the `cf set-env` or in your manifest file, you could include one environment variable in the definition of another variable, such as `SOMEPATH=$HOME/SOME/PATH`.

#### Solution

Remove interpolation from any environment variables.
