This document describes how CF operators can deploy volume services in Cloud Foundry (CF).

##<a id="overview"></a> Overview

A volume service gives apps access to an ephemeral filesystem, such as NFS. To provide a volume service for CF developers to use with their apps, you must deploy a driver and broker pair as outlined below in [Example: Deploy NFS to AWS](#example).

For more information about volume services and the drivers and brokers available to CF, see the following links:

* [Volume Services Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YtPMY9EjxlgJPa4SVVwIinfid_fshCF48xRhzyoZhrQ/edit?usp=sharing)
* [NFS Volume Release Repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/nfs-volume-release)
* [EFS Volume Release Repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/efs-volume-release)
* [CEPHFS Release Repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cephfs-bosh-release)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For test purposes, you can deploy the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/local-volume-release.git">Local Volume Release</a> if running a single Diego Cell CF deployment. This is not for production deployments.</p>

##<a id="example"></a> Example: Deploy NFS Volume Service to AWS

The following procedure provides an example of how to deploy the NFS broker and corresponding driver on AWS.

###<a id="pre"></a>Prerequisite

This procedure requires a BOSH director that is v260 or later. Refer to the [NFS Volume Release Repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/nfs-volume-release) for more information.

###<a id="cf"></a>Step 1: Enable Volume Services in CF

1. Using the BOSH CLI, run the following command to list the VMs deployed by your BOSH director:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh vms </pre>
	* Examine the output for the CF Cloud Controller VM and note the corresponding `deployment name` for use in the next step.
1. Run the following command using the `deployment name` from the last step to download your CF deployment manifest:
  <pre class="terminal"> $ bosh download manifest YOUR-CF-DEPLOYMENT-NAME > cf.yml</pre>
1. Add the following property to the `cf.yml` manifest if it does not already exist:
	`properties: cc: volume_services_enabled: true`
1. Redeploy CF with volume services enabled:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh -d cf.yml deploy</pre>

###<a id="driver"></a> Step 2: Add the NFS Driver to Diego Cells

1. Download the `nfs-volume-release` release from [bosh.io](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/nfs-volume-release).
1. Target your deployment using the BOSH CLI.
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP</pre>
1. Upload the release to your BOSH director
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh upload release PATH-TO-DOWNLOADED-NFS-VOLUME-RELEASE</pre>
	* Examine the output and record the `version` of the release you uploaded for later use.
	<pre>
	Release info
	------------
	Name:    nfs-volume
	<b>Version: 0.0.11</b>
	</pre>
1. Run the following command to list the VMs deployed by your BOSH director:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh vms </pre>
	* Examine the output for the diego cell VMs labeled `cell_*` and note the corresponding `deployment name` for use in the next step.
1. Create a new `runtime-config.yml` with the following content:
	* Replace `YOUR-VERSION` with the `version` you previously recorded.
	* For `YOUR-DIEGO-DEPLOYMENT-NAME`, use the noted `deployment name` from the previous step.

		```
		---
		releases:
		- name: nfs-volume
		  version: YOUR-VERSION
		addons:
		- name: voldrivers
		  include:
		    deployments:
		    - YOUR-DIEGO-DEPLOYMENT-NAME
		    jobs:
		    - name: rep
		      release: diego
		  jobs:
		  - name: nfsv3driver
		    release: nfs-volume
		    properties: {}
		```

1. Update the BOSH runtime configuration:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh update runtime-config runtime-config.yml</pre>
1. Download the Diego manifest:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh download manifest YOUR-DIEGO-DEPLOYMENT-NAME > diego.yml</pre>
1. Deploy Diego:
	<pre class="terminal"> $ bosh -d diego.yml deploy</pre>

###<a id="stubs"></a>Step 3: Generate a Manifest for the NFS Broker

To create a NFS Service Broker, you must combine several pieces of information into a single BOSH manifest to deploy. Follow the steps below to put this information into stubs and use a script to combine them into a manifest.

#### Create the Cloud Foundry Stub
1. Run the following command to list the VMs deployed by your BOSH director:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh vms </pre>
	* Examine the output for the CF Nats VM labeled `nats_*` and record the corresponding `deployment name` for use in the next step.
1. Run the following command using the `deployment name` from the previous step to download your CF deployment manifest:
  <pre class="terminal"> $ bosh download manifest YOUR-CF-DEPLOYMENT-NAME > cf.yml</pre>

#### Create the Director Stub

1. Run the following command to determine the UUID of your BOSH director:
	<pre class="terminal"> $ bosh status --uuid</pre>

2. Create a new `director.yml` file with the following contents from the last step:

	```
	---
	director_uuid: YOUR-UUID
	---
	```

#### Create the IaaS Settings Stub

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This is an AWS specific IaaS Settings Stub. If you want to deploy on another IaaS, use the templates available in the <code>templates</code> directory of each volume services release respository.</p>

1. Create an `iaas.yml` stub to for IaaS-specific settings by copying the template below:

	```
	 ---
     jobs:
     - name: nfsbroker
       networks:
       - name: public
         static_ips: [PUBLIC-BROKER-IP]

     networks:
     - name: nfsvolume-subnet
       subnets:
       - cloud_properties:
           security_groups:
           - SECURITY-GROUP
           subnet: SUBNET
         dns:
         - DNS
         gateway: GATEWAY
         range: SUBNET-RANGE
         reserved:
         - RESERVED-IPs
         static:
         - STATIC-IPs

     resource_pools:
       - name: medium
         stemcell:
            name: bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
            version: latest
         cloud_properties:
           instance_type: m3.medium
           availability_zone: us-east-1c
       - name: large
         stemcell:
           name: bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
           version: latest
         cloud_properties:
           instance_type: m3.large
           availability_zone: us-east-1c
	```

1. Replace each of the below parameters in the stub:

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th width="25%">For this value...</th>
			<th>Replace with...</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>PUBLIC-BROKER-IP</code></td>
			<td>A pre-allocated AWS Elastic IP address</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>SECURITY-GROUP</code></td>
			<td>A Security Group in which to create the NFS Broker. Ensure this security group can access the security group that your CF deployment is in.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>SUBNET</code></td>
			<td>A subnet in which to create the NFS Broker. Ensure this subnet can access the subnet that your CF deployment is in.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>DNS</code></td>
			<td>Typically the DNS for your CF system domain unless you want to host the broker outside of CF.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>GATEWAY</code></td>
			<td>Typically the gateway address for your CF system domain unless you want to host the broker outside of CF.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>SUBNET-RANGE</code></td>
			<td>The CIDR range of the subnet in which to create the NFS Broker.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>RESERVED-IPs</code></td>
			<td>An Array of IP addresses that BOSH cannot use for the NFS Broker, such as <code>10.10.200.0 - 10.10.200.10</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>STATIC-IPs</code></td>
			<td>Array of IP addresses that BOSH can use for the NFS Broker, such as <code>10.10.200.10 - 10.10.200.100</code></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

#### Create the Credentials Stub

Create a `creds.yml` file and paste in the following contents, replacing the indicated values with a username and password of your choosing:

```
---
properties:
  nfsbroker:
    username: BROKER_USERNAME
    password: BROKER_PASSWORD
```

#### Generate the Deployment Manifest

1. Clone the NFS Volume Release repository:
<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone http<span>s</span>://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/nfs-volume-release.git
</pre>

1. Change directories into the repo you just cloned:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cd nfs-volume-release
</pre>

1. Run the following script to generate a deployment manifest based on your stubs:
<pre class="terminal">
$ ./scripts/generate_manifest.sh cf.yml director-uuid.yml iaas.yml creds.yml
</pre>

###<a id="broker"></a>Step 4: Deploy the NFS Broker

1. Deploy the broker using the generated manifest:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ bosh -d nfsvolume-aws-manifest.yml deploy
	</pre>

1. Register the broker using the credentials specified in the `creds.yml` stub:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf create-service-broker nfsbroker BROKER_USERNAME BROKER_PASSWORD http://nfs-broker.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
	</pre>

1. Grant access to the service of the broker:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf enable-service-access nfs
	</pre>


	CF Developers can now create an NFS service and bind instances to their apps as outlined in [Using an External File System (Volume Services)](../volume-services-v2.10.html)
